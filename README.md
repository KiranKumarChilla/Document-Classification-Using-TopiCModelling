 I have calculated DocumentTerm Matrix in Python(DTmatrix.py). The document-files folder contains 50 text files (all these files are of Mapreduce(Bigdata) domain) which i used to create my DocumentTermMatrix.
SvdCal.m contains the code to read the calculated Document Term Matrix  and to apply SVD.
output.txt has the result.
